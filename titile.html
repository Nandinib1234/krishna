<h2><font color="green" face="impact">The Rāmāyana (/rɑmɑːjənə/;[1][2] Sanskrit: रामायणम्,[3] IAST: Rāmāyaṇam) is a Sanskrit epic composed over a period of nearly a millennium, with scholars' </hr>estimates for the earliest stage of the text ranging from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE,[4] and later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.[5] Ramayana is one of the two important epics of Hinduism, the other being the Mahābhārata.[6]</font>

<p><font color="red" size="5">The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Sita, the Princess of Janakpur, and Rama, a legendary prince of Ayodhya city in the kingdom of Kosala. <p>The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the<p align="center"> request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – the king of Lanka, </p>that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.</p></font>

The Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of nearly 24,000 verses (mostly set in the Shloka/Anustubh meter), divided into seven Khanda (parts) the first and the seventh being later additions.[7] It belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (purāvṛtta), interspersed with teachings on the goals of human life.
